# ClothingStore

This project was made by a team of four people including myself, I particularly worked on the browse functionality, which is kind of the home page for users, as it also displays a list of items on auction currently, along with a sorting/searching functionality based on color, price, name, brand, and searching for auctions that have already ended in the preceding months that are similar to an item that you are interesting in. I also worked on the history of bids for a user on a specific auction, alerts for users when an item they are interested in is currently available to be bid on, and seeing a history of all auctions a user has bid on. We also worked on an ER and RS diagram together for the project.
